# predict-bike-sharing
This is the project for UDACITY Nanodegree program of Deep learning. The data are downloaded from Udacity.
The objective of this project is to estimate how many bikes are needed for the bike-share companies every day. The features that are considered in this projects include time-related variables (year, date, weekday/weekend) and weather related variables. The prediction is done by building a neural network (multiple layer perceptron) from scratch, so only numpy and pandas are allowed.
